    "# ICESat-2 AWS cloud data access\n",
    "This notebook ({nb-download}`download <IS2_cloud_data_access.ipynb>`) illustrates the use of icepyx for accessing ICESat-2 data currently available through the AWS (Amazon Web Services) us-west2 hub s3 data bucket.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes\n",
    "1. ICESat-2 data became publicly available on the cloud on 29 September 2022. Thus, access methods and example workflows are still being developed by NSIDC, and the underlying code in icepyx will need to be updated now that these data (and the associated metadata) are available. We appreciate your patience and contributions (e.g. reporting bugs, sharing your code, etc.) during this transition!\n",
    "2. This example and the code it describes are part of ongoing development. Current limitations to using these features are described throughout the example, as appropriate.\n",
    "3. You **MUST** be working within an AWS instance. Otherwise, you will get a permissions error.\n",
    "4. Cloud authentication is still more user-involved than we'd like. We're working to address this - let us know if you'd like to join the conversation!"
