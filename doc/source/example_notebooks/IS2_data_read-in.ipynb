    "# Reading ICESat-2 Data in for Analysis\n",
    "This notebook ({nb-download}`download <IS2_data_read-in.ipynb>`) illustrates the use of icepyx for reading ICESat-2 data files, loading them into a data object.\n",
    "Currently the default data object is an Xarray Dataset, with ongoing work to provide support for other data object types.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information on how to order and download ICESat-2 data, see the [icepyx data access tutorial](https://icepyx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_notebooks/IS2_data_access.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation\n",
    "Most often, when you open a data file, you must specify the underlying data structure and how you'd like the information to be read in.\n",
    "A simple example of this, for instance when opening a csv or similarly delimited file, is letting the software know if the data contains a header row, what the data type is (string, double, float, boolean, etc.) for each column, what the delimeter is, and which columns or rows you'd like to be loaded.\n",
    "Many ICESat-2 data readers are quite manual in nature, requiring that you accurately type out a list of string paths to the various data variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "icepyx simplifies this process by relying on its awareness of ICESat-2 specific data file variable storage structure.\n",
    "Instead of needing to manually iterate through the beam pairs, you can provide a few options to the `Read` object and icepyx will do the heavy lifting for you (as detailed in this notebook).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach\n",
    "If you're interested in what's happening under the hood: icepyx turns your instructions into something called a catalog, then uses the Intake library and the catalog to actually load the data into memory. Specifically, icepyx creates an [Intake](https://intake.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) data [catalog](https://intake.readthedocs.io/en/latest/catalog.html) for each requested variable and then merges the read-in data from each of the variables to create a single data object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intake catalogs are powerful (and the tool we selected) because they can be saved, shared, modified, and reused to reproducibly read in a set of data files in a consistent way as part of an analysis workflow.\n",
    "This approach streamlines the transition between data sources (local/downloaded files or, ultimately, cloud/bucket access) and data object types (e.g. [Xarray Dataset](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/generated/xarray.Dataset.html) or [GeoPandas GeoDataFrame](https://geopandas.org/docs/reference/api/geopandas.GeoDataFrame.html))."
